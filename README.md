If you're looking for a software developer slash certified advanced adventurer scuba diver then look no further! I am a recent coding convert, transitioning from retail strategy roles into a full stack developer. I recently graduated from the intensive 12 week coding bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://Makers.tech) where I was immersed into the world of pair programming, object oriented design and test driven development. I am open minded and perceptive, with a focus on self-growth and would like to work for a company which encourages further growth and development.
