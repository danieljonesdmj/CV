If you're looking for a software developer slash certified advanced adventurer scuba diver then look no further! I am a recent coding convert, transitioning from retail strategy roles into a full stack developer. I am a graduate from the intensive 16 week coding bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://Makers.tech) where I was immersed into the world of pair programming, object oriented design and test driven development. I would love to work for a company which encourages further growth and development and give me the chance to continue learning.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (June 2018 to September 2018)

I spent 16 weeks enjoying learning many different languages and frameworks. 

There is also a lot of emphasis on pair programming, agile processes, clean code, SOLID, DRY, and TDD.

Technologies used include 
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Swift, RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Liverpool (September 2012 - July 2016)

- Psychology Bsc (Hons)
- 2:2
- Modules included: Forensic and Investigative Psychology, Conflict Psychology, Psychology of Expertise, Phytopharmacology.
Final Research Project: Body Perception in Young Women.

#### Other qualifications

[SSI](https://www.divessi.com/info/en/advanced-adventurer-180.html) Advanced Adventurer certification in scuba diving.

## Skills

#### Communication
Whilst working in my role for John Lewis Partnership strong communication skills were vital. I was required to work with many stakeholders including suppliers, warehouse partners, and branch partners to ensure stock was received and delivered to the right place at the right time- mistakes could cost the company thousands.
I have experience explaining complex information to laypersons of differing backgrounds and ages, as demonstrated by giving tax advice at HMRC, and technical broadband support for Virgin Media.
Experience of giving presentations at university to groups from twenty to one hundred people.
Degree was focused heavily on essay writing, developed strong English spelling and grammar.

#### Teamwork

I love being part of a tight-knit team all pulling towards the same goal and enjoy collaborating with others. I am a very adaptable person and can always find my niche within a team - I know when to lead and when to take a back-seat and have been told by my peers that I am good to pair with.

#### Transferable skills

I gained skills during my degree which I have found useful for my transition into coding. My degree strongly emphasised the scentific method which gave me a good process to follow. I had statistics modules which helped me with viewing and analysing lots of data, and I also gained strong research skills. I find this particulary useful when searching for solutions online, I can sift out useful information and hone in on what I need quickly.

## Experience

Learnt how to write SQL from the 'Joes to Pros' series of books which included querying tables, using joins, and creating stored procedures. Initial way of putting new SQL skills into practice was to find and debug errors in the codebase. Used problem-solving skills to identify locations of the errors and implemented fixes with a focus on optimum performance.
